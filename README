Hi! Well if you are reading this message then I am allready excited!

So according to people I know Github is a really cool thing and it is good for storing code in the cloud
I went ahead and plopped all my shit into Github and now, people can make changes of their own!

Im not an experenced programer so if you want to help me in any way, drop me a comment!
(Wherever it is that you drop comments)

If you are new(like me) head over to the 'wiki' tab and read how to set up the dev enviroment
Ill try to keep the wiki updated as I get into new languages.

Cheers!

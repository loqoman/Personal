Neat! Now this is a engine that I want to get running in a couple of months, it will involve a lot of time spent at home and at school.

This is a ticks engineth
No,
Not tits Shalin
Ticks.
Ticks, as in the measure of time. I want to make a engine that can run games based on this tick system
checking for things every tick update

Thats the synopsis,

Some notes before you get started:

 -There are only ever going to be 20 ticks a secound,
 I dont really know why right now, that is just the way that it is going to end up right now

Code wise I want to work on the following things:

 -Changing the names of some of the tick commands
 -Add an example thing that checks for something to show ticks in process

Edit:

~Can I use the same cool dashey thingy?~
